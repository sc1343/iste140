			<h3>The history of the Internet</h3>
			<p>The history of the Internet has its origin in the efforts of wide area networking that originated 
			in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France.</p>
			<p>The U.S. Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s, including for the development 
			of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. The first message 
			was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at
			 University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
			 It is a worldwide network of interconnected computers and related equipment. </p>
			 <p>Used as a “backbone” for other online applica2ons, including email, instant messaging, Skype, streaming video, 
			 and the World Wide Web.</p>

			<h3>World Wide Web</h3>
			<p>the World Wide Web refers to hypermedia using Hypertext Markup Language or HTML. 
			This unique language allows information to be linked so when a person selects or clicks on one
			 part of a link their browser automatically finds the designated information. 
			 Thus, the Web's unique characteristic is that it empowers the user to "click" 
			 on a word and be transported to a related web location. The development of this
			  innovation is attributed to Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at the CERN Institute of Geneva, 
			  Switzerland who is credited for the creation of the first links on the World Wide Web. </p>
		
			<h3>Early Internet technologies</h3>
			<p>EMail, FTP, Telnet, and Usenet news have been around since the early days of the Internet; 
			they're actually extensions of services provided well before the Internet even existed. 
			The World Wide Web (WWW) is a new, entirely Internet-based concept, based in part on existing services, 
			and in part on a new protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
		
			<p>The WWW is the collection of HTTP servers (see the description of HTTP below) on the Internet. 
			The Web is responsible, in large part, for the recent explosion in Internet activity. 
			WWW is based on concepts developed at the European Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN)
			 in Geneva, Switzerland, by Tim Berners-Lee and others. Much of the groundbreaking work 
			 on Web clients was done at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
			  at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. There are many organizations and individuals
		  	 developing Web client and server software these days, and many more using these technologies 
		  	 for a huge range of purposes. Nobody "controls" the Web, however, much as nobody "controls" the Internet.</p>
		   
	
		
			<p>HTTP is the primary application protocol that underlies the World Wide Web: it provides 
			users access to the files that make up the Web. As mentioned above, these files might be 
			in many different formats (text, graphics, audio, video, etc.), but the most common format on 
			the Web is the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML is a standardized page description language 
			for creating Web pages. It provides basic document-formatting capabilities (including the ability 
			to include graphics), and allows you to specify hypertext links to other servers and files.</P>
