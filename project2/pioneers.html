		<h2><strong>key players involved with the creation of the Internet and Web</strong></h2>
	
		
		<h3>Vannevar Bush, D.Eng. </h3>
		<p>Vannevar Bush facilitated a relationship between the federal government, 
		the American scientific community, and business. After the war, he helped 
		institutionalize that relationship. As a result, organizations like the National
		 Science Foundation and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), were created. 
		 It was at ARPA that the Internet first began. Bush also wrote a paper entitled, 
		 "As We May Think," in 1945. In this paper he described a theoretical storage and 
		 retrieval device, called a "memex," which would use a system remarkably similar 
		 to what we now call hypertext. </p>

		<h3>Douglas Engelbart, Ph.D.  </h3>
		<p>A researcher at Stanford, Englebart’s Augmentation Research Center was the second 
		node on ARPANet in October 1969.  He developed the Network Information Center at Stanford, 
		which would later become the domain name registry, or the database listing every website on 
		the Internet.  It is interesting to note that Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the developers of 
		Google, also went to Stanford nearly 30 years later. </p>

		<h3>Ted Nelson, Ph.D. </h3>
		<p>In 1960 he founded Project Xanadu with the goal of creating a computer network with a 
		simple user interface. Project Xanadu was to be a worldwide electronic publishing 
		system using hypertext linking that would have created a universal library.In 1963 
		he coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia". In 1974 he wrote and published two books in one, 
		Computer Lib/Dream Machines,that has been hailed as "the most important book in the history of new 
		media."</p>

		In 1976 he co-founded Apple Inc., which later became the world's largest information technology 
		company by revenue and largest company in the world by market capitalization. He and Apple co-founder
		 Steve Jobs are widely recognized as two prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution of 
		 the 1970s and 1980s</p>

		<h3>Tim Berners-Lee, KBE  </h3>
		<p>an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web.
		 He is currently a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and Professor
		  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He made a proposal for an information management 
		  system on 12 March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext
		   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November the same year.</p>

		<h3>Rob Hartill, Ph.D. </h3>
		<p> a computer programmer and web designer best known for his work on the Internet Movie Database website 
		and the Apache web server and is notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web.
		In 1993, he became involved with the rec.arts.movies database that went on to become the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
		 On 5 August 1993 he announced the first web version of the database. In 1994, Hartill moved to Los Alamos in New Mexico 
		 to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory on the ArXiv.org e-print archive with Paul Ginsparg.
		  At the same time, he was a co-founder of the Apache Software Foundation, and made many contributions to the
		   early development of the Apache HTTP Server. In 1994, Hartill was one of five inductees in the Hall of Fame
		 announced at the First International Conference on the World Wide Web. In 1996, the Internet Movie Database was founded, 
		 and Rob returned to Ogmore-by-Sea in Wales before leaving the IMDb in 2000 and emigrating to South Australia in May 2003.
		  He's currently a volunteer fire-fighter with the Country Fire Service and a hobby farmer.</p>

		 Robert E. Kahn, for founding and developing the Internet. In 2004, Cerf was the recipient of the ACM Alan M. Turing 
		 award (sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of Computer Science”) and in 2005 he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
		 by President George Bush. Cerf began his work at the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects
		  Agency (DARPA) playing a key role in leading the development of Internet and Internet-related data packet and security 
		  technologies. Since 2005, he has served as vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google. In this role,
