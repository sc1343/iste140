		<h3>What is HTTP</h3>
		<p>THTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol 
		defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response 
		to various commands. </p>
		<p> For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to 
		fetch and transmit the requested Web page. The other main standard that controls how the World Wide Web works is HTML, which 
		covers how Web pages are formatted and displayed.</p>
		

		<h3>HTTP & TCP: HOW IT WORKS</h3>
		<p>When you type an address such as www.codecademy.com into your browser, you are commanding it to open a TCP channel to the server 
		that responds to that URL (or Uniform Resource Locator, which you can read more about on Wikipedia). A URL is like your home address
		 or phone number because it describes how to reach you. In this situation, your computer, which is making the request, 
		 is called the client. The URL you are requesting is the address that belongs to the server.</p>
		 
		 <p>Once the TCP connection is established, the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage it should 
		 display. After the server has sent the response, it closes the TCP connection. If you open the website in your browser again, 
		 or if your browser automatically requests something from the server, a new connection is opened which follows the same process 
		 described above. After you type the URL into your browser, your browser will extract the http part and recognize that it is the name
		  of the network protocol to use. Then, it takes the domain name from the URL, and asks the internet Domain Name Server to return an 
		  Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
