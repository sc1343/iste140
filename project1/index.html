		<p>There is a story behind what I like photographing, Some years ago, I serendipitously looked out of the car’s window and was immediately mesmerized by what I saw - 
		 the street light lit up a city block like a star lit sky. I immediately took out my phone and took some pictures. 
		I was intrigued and wanted to learn more about photography and Photoshop in general as a habit, 
		I like photography; when I focus on photography, all the pressures from life will disappear. I can use different perspectives to look at this world, and gain valuable experiences. 
		Another interest that I have is handmade, I can using many different items, put them together create the new things. For me, this process is meaningful and i'm relax when I doing that.
