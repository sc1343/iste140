	<h2>factors that might cause or develop a phobia</h2>
	<p>   </p>


	


	
	<h3>Classical conditioning</h3>
	<p>  Classical conditioning is an example that might cause phobia, for example people who have been injured in
	 car accidents might develop an intense fear of riding in all cars. </p>
	<p> people who experiment with a car accident might connect the tense fear reactions of death to riding the 
	cars or they might consider that every time they ride the cars will result in a dangerous. As a result,
	 this tense fear reaction developing phobia through classical conditioning.</p>
	
	<h3>Because of evolution</h3>
	 <p>evolutionary theorists contend the reason for that might be because those objects or situations might
	  be a real danger to our ancestors.</p>
	  
	 <p>For example, the human might experience fear when exposed to mice, snakes, and bats. 
	 Rather than bird, rabbit, and duck. That might be because of a long-time age,
	  when our ancestors were alive, some of those animals cause danger or hurt our ancestors. 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p> As a result, the ancestor whose genetic makeup allowed them to quickly learn those dangerous to avoid hazards were more 
	 likely to help them survive and reproduce, and pass those traits to us. </p>
	 
	 <p>Our evolutionary heritage makes many of us unduly anxious, the genes that trigger such anxiety.</p>
