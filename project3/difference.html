	 <p> There is a difference between phobia and rational fears. A phobia is more like an 
	exaggerated and irrational fear of some specific objects or situations. </p>
	
		
	<p>On the other hand, 
	fear is an emotional reaction to a specific, real danger. </p>

	<h4>The examples that help to distinguish the difference</h4>

	<p>When there is a murder pointing a knife at you or when you encountering a mugger. It is conder a rational fear, 
	it is the natural emotion that protects people from harm when facing real danger.</p> 
	
	<p>However, if someone has a phobia they might experience some intense fear of a certain object or situation. 
	Phobias cause significant distress, which might interfere with people’s daily life.</p>

	<h4>Clinical phobias and Subclinical phobias</h4>
	

	<p>
	 The subclinical phobias are mild irrational fears that do not interfere with human’s daily functioning.
	  For example, some people have acrophobia, fear of heights. When they are in the skyscraper or walking on the stairs,
	   they might feel scared; however, at the same time they can stay in the skyscraper or walking on the stairs for normal
	    activities despite the fear, did not interfere or obstructing in daily life.
	</p>		
	
	<p>In contrast, the example for clinical phobias of acrophobia is when a person experiences intense fear when they located in a high location
	, such as a skyscraper or unable to use the stairs to avoid any movement.<p>
